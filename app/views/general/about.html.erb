      <h4>Short Story</h4>
      <p>Character Sheets is the online storage and tool for managing pen-and-paper roleplaying characters. It has an ability to export your characters in nicely formatted character sheets (PDF format) for later use during game sessions. This project was created by GM for GMs and players.</p>

      <h4>Long Story</h4>
      Years of running different games proved players to have been leaving their character sheets somewhere. Sometimes, when I (or my fellow GMs) run games it turns out that one or several players forgot to bring their character sheet, especially it happens with newcommers. This can be a bottleneck for your game, especially when you use some heavy rule system like D&D or GURPS where numbers really matter. In such case what you usually do is try to find player's sheet somewhere in your docs or ... maybe in cloud storage or ... probably it is somewhere in your social network chat ... well, shit, it isn't there. Character Sheets are intended to solve this problem. Please give it a try, I hope you will like it as much as I do <3
